                <h3>A computer program is a series of specific instructions that tells a computer what to do. It is a list of specific and odered instructions that you write using a programming language that a computer understands</h3>

                 <h2>So why learn computer programming?</h2> 
                 <p>Easy! Because heroes do not let computers tell them what to do, they tell computers what to do. They do not let computers use them. Heroes use computers to solve problems. If you are going to try. Go all the way. Otherwise do not even try. If you are going to try, all the way. This could mean. Losings girlfriends, friends, wives, and even your mind. Go all the way.<br> 
                    
            
                     And this is why that is so important. Check out the video below.</p>
